# WAD_Code

This is the Web Application Development code. 

This is code that was used in the lecture and lab for Web Application Development. It represents a range of disconnected example code sniplets
that highlight a range of aspects of PHP-based problems. It demonstrates a number of solutions to common things one might want to do with PHP. 
I will try to turn this around, eventually, into a more consistant built-up of an example. Currently, however, this is more of a scrambled 
collection of mini examples. Nevertheless, I still hope it is useful.
